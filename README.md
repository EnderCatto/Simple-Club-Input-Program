# Simple-Club-Input-Program
Simple start into my C programming 

About the program : This is a basic C program that interacts with the user by asking for a club number and then printing a personalized message based on the input.
Uses : 
      - scanf (disadvantage of it -> vulnerable to buffer overflow if the input exceeds the allowed limit.), due to macro _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
      - static array input of 10 characters (not dynamic)
